## About HARelay

HARelay provides secure remote access to Home Assistant without port forwarding. Users get a unique subdomain (e.g., yourname.harelay.com) and install a lightweight add-on that creates a secure WebSocket tunnel.

## Key Features

- **No Port Forwarding Required**: Works behind any firewall or NAT
- **Secure WebSocket Tunnel**: End-to-end encrypted connection
- **Custom Subdomains**: Each user gets a unique, memorable URL
- **Simple Setup**: Install add-on, enter credentials, connect
- **Full Home Assistant Support**: Works with all HA features including real-time updates

2. User gets a unique subdomain and connection token
3. User installs the HARelay add-on in Home Assistant

5. Users can now access their Home Assistant from anywhere via their subdomain
